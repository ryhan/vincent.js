# Vincent.js
Please don't take this too seriously.

Also, check out the [demo](http://ryhan.me/lab/vincentjs/).

## Usage
First, include vincent.js.
`<script type="text/javascript" src="vincent.js"></script>`

Then, call `vincent().init();`. This adds Vincent's image to the DOM.

Use `vincent().sayHello();` to make Vincent appear. 

If you're lazy, use `vincent().fuckYeah();` to bring up Vincent every time someone clicks a link.

## Notes
Please, please, please don't take this seriously.
